#Fizzbuzz

A common puzzle whereby you have to print a list of ascending integers.
* If the integer is divisible by three the string 'fizz' is printed instead of the integer
* If the integer is divisible by five the string 'buzz' is printed.
* If the integer is divisible by both three and five the string 'fizzbuzz' is printed

The recursive function presented here accepts a single argument (integer) and will return the fizzbuzz sequence
upto and including that number
