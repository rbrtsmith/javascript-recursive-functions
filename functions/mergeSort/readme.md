#mergeSort

A recursive divide and conquer algorithm that is super efficient.
The function takes a single argument (array) and sorts it alphabetically

There is scope to extend this so that it could also take an `sortBy` function to behave
more similarly to JavaScripts native sort method.

```javascript
mergeSort([2, 1, 3]) // [1, 2, 3]
```
