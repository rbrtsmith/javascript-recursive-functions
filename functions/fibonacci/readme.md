#Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence, used extensively in architecture and design is characterised by the fact that each
number after the initial two are the sum of the preceding ones:
```
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
```

The recursive function here takes a single argument (integer) and returns the corresponding fibonacci number
```javascript
fibonacci(10) // 55
```
